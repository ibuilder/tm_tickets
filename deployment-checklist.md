# Production Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your Time & Materials Ticket Generator is properly configured for production use.

## Pre-Deployment Testing

- [ ] Test all form validations and calculations
- [ ] Test database functionality (add, edit, delete materials/equipment)
- [ ] Test PDF generation with various data inputs
- [ ] Test email functionality if using the server implementation
- [ ] Test digital signatures
- [ ] Verify all buttons and UI elements work as expected
- [ ] Test in all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Test on mobile devices and tablets

## File Verification

### Standalone Implementation
- [ ] `index.html` - Contains all markup and references to CSS/JS files
- [ ] `styles.css` - Contains all styling (not style.css)
- [ ] `app.js` - Contains all application logic

### Modular Implementation
- [ ] All standalone files plus:
- [ ] `main.js` - Entry point with proper module imports
- [ ] `dbService.js` - Database service module
- [ ] `emailService.js` - Email service module
- [ ] `pdfService.js` - PDF generation module
- [ ] `server.js` - Express server setup
- [ ] `package.json` - Node.js dependencies and scripts

## Environment Configuration

- [ ] Set proper NODE_ENV=production if using Node.js
- [ ] Configure SMTP settings for email functionality
- [ ] Set appropriate port for the server
- [ ] Configure CORS settings if client and server are on different domains
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates if using HTTPS

## Performance Optimization

- [ ] Minify JavaScript files
- [ ] Minify CSS files
- [ ] Optimize images
- [ ] Enable gzip/brotli compression on the server
- [ ] Configure appropriate cache headers

## Security Checks

- [ ] Ensure HTTPS is used for all connections
- [ ] Validate all user inputs
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- [ ] Sanitize HTML content to prevent XSS attacks
- [ ] Use secure cookies if implementing authentication
- [ ] Implement proper error handling without exposing system details

## Server Configuration (Modular Implementation)

- [ ] Install required Node.js dependencies: `npm install`
- [ ] Set up process manager (PM2, Forever, etc.) for Node.js
- [ ] Configure server monitoring
- [ ] Set up logging
- [ ] Configure proper server restart policies
- [ ] Set up automated backups if using a database

## Final Verification

- [ ] Test the application in the production environment
- [ ] Verify all features work as expected
- [ ] Check for console errors
- [ ] Test email functionality in production
- [ ] Test PDF generation in production
- [ ] Verify database persistence in production
- [ ] Document any environment-specific configurations

## Contingency Plan

- [ ] Create backup of all files
- [ ] Document rollback procedure
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Prepare contact information for technical support

## Post-Deployment

- [ ] Monitor application performance
- [ ] Track any errors or issues
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Plan for future updates and enhancements
